# BotDemos

This is where I'm putting any demo code for bots created via the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

##Pig Latin Bot

This is a bare-bones bot that translates English to Pig Latin. The bot will reply with whatever you type, translated to Pig Latin.

    Note: Also contains an example of how to use the WebChat control.

## PC Bot

Demonstrates how to handle various Bot Framework Messages.

## Bug Dialog Bot

Shows how to use Bot Builder dialogs.

## Bug FormFlow Bot #1

Has a very basic FormFlow example.

## Bug FormFlow Bot #2

Implements dynamic fields in FormFlow (e.g. selection based on DB options.)

## Contact Info Bot

Uses LUIS for natural language understanding.
